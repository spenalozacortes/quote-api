# Quote API
A simple quote-serving JSON API written in JavaScript with Express.js.

This is a Codecademy project and my first API ever! :)

## To do

1. ~~Add a PUT route for updating quotes in the data array.~~
2. ~~Add a DELETE route for deleting quotes from the data array.~~
3. ~~Fix the POST route so that it adds an ID to the new quote.~~
4. Learn to connect to a database.
5. Figure out how to deploy this thing.

A better README coming soon...
