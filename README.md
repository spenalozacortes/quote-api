# Quote API
A simple quote-serving JSON API written in JavaScript with Express.js.

This is a Codecademy project and my first API ever! :)

## To do

1. Add a PUT route for updating quotes in the data array.
2. ~~Add a DELETE route for deleting quotes from the data array.~~
3. Learn to connect to a database.
4. Figure out how to deploy this thing.

A better README coming soon...
